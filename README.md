# Analysis of Denver Crash Data Using Random Forest
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting accident severity using a machine learning model. The dataset is sourced from the Colorado Department of Transportation (CODOT) and contains various factors that may influence the severity of accidents, such as weather conditions, road conditions, and time of day. The Random Forest Classifier was selected as the primary model for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.
## Key Objectives
  * Predict the severity of accidents based on multiple factors using the Random Forest Classifier.
  * Improve model accuracy through data cleaning, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
  * Analyze the influence of environmental and situational factors on accident severity.
## Methodology
1. Data Preparation:
    * The dataset was cleaned, addressing missing values and outliers.
    * Key features were selected, such as weather conditions, road surface, and time of day, which were used to predict accident severity.

2. Modeling:
    * A baseline Random Forest model was initially implemented.
    * The model was refined through hyperparameter tuning, iteratively improving performance.

3. Evaluation:
    * Model performance was measured using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics, allowing for a detailed evaluation of prediction effectiveness.
## Results and Insights
  * The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated reasonable accuracy in predicting accident severity.
  * Hyperparameter tuning slightly improved the modelâ€™s accuracy over the baseline model.
  * The analysis highlighted the importance of certain factors, such as weather and road conditions, in determining accident outcomes.

## Future Work
  * Incorporating additional features, such as the number of vehicles involved or demographic information like driver age, could enhance the predictive power of the model.
  * Exploring other machine learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, may yield further improvements in accuracy.
  * A deeper analysis of feature importance could provide additional insights into which factors most significantly affect accident severity.
